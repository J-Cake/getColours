# Get Windows Colours

`GetColours` is a simple module that returns the colours of the Windows 10 Theme.

The module is very simple. Just `require('@klaussmc/getcolours')()` and you get back an object of colours that windows has set.

> **Note:** This module is written specifically for Windows 10. It may not work on Windows 8.1, 8 or 7, let alone MacOs.
